00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,937
I can't believe we're eating here.

10
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:36,572
This place is so demeaning.

11
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:37,973
Well, when you can afford to pay,

12
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:39,208
you can pick the restaurant.

13
00:00:39,242 --> 00:00:41,677
But should that day ever
come... and it won't...

14
00:00:41,712 --> 00:00:43,646
we'll still be coming here
for the same reason.

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,648
Great pastrami!

16
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:47,016
You're a pig.

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,284
At least I'm not broke.

18
00:00:48,318 --> 00:00:49,652
At least I'm not a loser.

19
00:00:49,686 --> 00:00:50,753
I'm not a loser!

20
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:53,522
Knock it off, you two!

21
00:00:53,557 --> 00:00:56,092
Hi, welcome to Boobers
where we got a Double D

22
00:00:56,126 --> 00:00:57,493
from the health department.

23
00:00:57,527 --> 00:00:58,594
Zoe?

24
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:00,496
I-I haven't seen you
since high school.

25
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,831
Oh, my God!

26
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:03,065
Hayley!

27
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,301
Sorry, I try not to make eye contact

28
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:06,769
with my customers.

29
00:01:06,803 --> 00:01:08,871
They never make eye contact with me.

30
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:10,840
They should be ashamed of themselves!

31
00:01:10,874 --> 00:01:13,309
You are not just some objects.

32
00:01:13,343 --> 00:01:15,845
Wow, it's been forever.

33
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,279
So, where you living now?

34
00:01:17,314 --> 00:01:18,280
At home.

35
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:20,015
Actually, I did move out for a bit.

36
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,517
To your boyfriend's van.

37
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:24,854
You know, me and Kristen
and Danuta still hang out.

38
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:27,189
We're all going to the Skylark tonight.

39
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:28,257
You should come.

40
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,291
Yeah, that sounds fun.

41
00:01:29,326 --> 00:01:30,493
Great.

42
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:32,094
I'll be back in a minute
to take your order.

43
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:33,162
Hold on, lady.

44
00:01:33,196 --> 00:01:35,030
I'm actually here on official business.

45
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:36,999
F.B.I.

46
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:41,337
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to verify those alleged breasts.

47
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:44,306
I'm not falling for this again.

48
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:47,943
Well, machine says
your I.D. checks out.

49
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:50,746
Why do you guys keep hassling me?

50
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:52,648
Zoe, don't!
This is fake.

51
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:53,649
My brother made it.

52
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:55,217
Boo!
Boo!

53
00:01:55,252 --> 00:01:56,619
Let me ask you.

54
00:01:56,653 --> 00:01:59,522
How do your parents feel
about you working here?

55
00:01:59,556 --> 00:02:00,756
Hey, how's everyone doing?

56
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,392
You enjoying my little girl's boobs?

57
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,096
Thanks for inviting me out, guys.

58
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,864
It's so fun hanging out again.

59
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,666
Well, it's a little early to say that,

60
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:13,869
I.D.'s.

61
00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:15,037
They're carding?

62
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:17,206
You don't have
a fake I.D.?

63
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,208
You got to go to Kevin Ramage.

64
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:21,010
He'll make you one for 200 bucks.

65
00:02:21,044 --> 00:02:22,845
Plus you got to make out with him.

66
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,113
What?

67
00:02:24,147 --> 00:02:26,215
I-I can't afford $200.

68
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:28,384
Oh, bummer.

69
00:02:28,418 --> 00:02:30,953
I guess we'll catch you later then.

70
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:33,889
You were right, she was too optimistic.

71
00:02:33,924 --> 00:02:35,524
I know a club that doesn't card.

72
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:39,461
The club of Jesus Christ
of Latter-Day Saints.

73
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:41,397
Hey, how's the tail in there tonight?

74
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:43,432
Fine as hell, dawg.

75
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,277
Hey, buddy.

76
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:57,613
It's called Fortress of Solitude,

77
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:59,248
not Fortress of Come On In.

78
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:00,549
Oh, right.

79
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:02,184
Star Trek Wars.

80
00:03:03,353 --> 00:03:04,320
I can't even...

81
00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:05,321
First of all...

82
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:06,622
You're-you're not...

83
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:08,591
What do you want?

84
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,459
I just wanted to say how impressed I was

85
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:12,361
with your Federal Boobie Inspector card.

86
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:14,730
And I was wondering if you could maybe do

87
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:16,599
a fake driver's license for me?

88
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:17,600
Yeah?

89
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:19,301
Oh, I-I thought
I was a loser.

90
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:21,237
You know who the real losers are, Steve?

91
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:24,740
The ones who stay angry
after being called losers.

92
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:26,775
Okay, I'll do it.

93
00:03:27,777 --> 00:03:29,578
What a loser.

94
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:33,849
Oh, you got a fake I.D.?

95
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:35,818
I didn't think you could afford one.

96
00:03:35,852 --> 00:03:37,219
That's funny.

97
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:38,988
And, you know who would love that joke?

98
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:40,756
My butler, but he wouldn't laugh,

99
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,791
because he's a great butler.

100
00:03:46,897 --> 00:03:49,231
Wait, you're scanning
I.D.'s now?

101
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:50,599
We're cracking down ever since

102
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:53,135
that toddler died of alcohol poisoning.

103
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,704
They teach you a lot of
things in bouncer school,

104
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,108
but they don't teach you
how to live with a mistake.

105
00:03:59,142 --> 00:04:00,843
Nope.

106
00:04:00,877 --> 00:04:02,878
Nope.

107
00:04:02,913 --> 00:04:05,514
Nope.

108
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:07,283
Yep.

109
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:08,984
Go on in.

110
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:11,353
Hayley, wow.

111
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:12,955
Did Ramage make you that?

112
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,356
No, I got my own guy.

113
00:04:14,391 --> 00:04:16,625
Yo, can your guy make me a certification

114
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,060
to be a heart surgeon?

115
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:19,895
'Cause my mama's got a bad heart,

116
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,431
and I just know I could
do something about it

117
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:25,267
if I could just get in there.

118
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:29,171
Hey, buddy.

119
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:30,406
Not now.

120
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:35,110
You-you'll have
to excuse me.

121
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:36,445
We've had a lot of trouble

122
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,781
with kids breaking in
and building blanket forts.

123
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:40,950
Steve, my friends here would like

124
00:04:40,984 --> 00:04:42,685
to buy some
fake I.D.'s from you.

125
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,186
Buy fake I.D.'s?

126
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,189
Hayley, can I talk to you
in private for a minute?

127
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:53,329
Hayley, what you're suggesting
could get us in deep trouble.

128
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:55,597
You're selling fake I.D.'s
to teenagers.

129
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:57,700
At most, you'd get a slap on the wrist.

130
00:04:57,734 --> 00:04:58,767
Aah!

131
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:00,302
But I use my wrists all the time.

132
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,237
Steve, you won't get in trouble.

133
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:04,573
I mean, with your talent
and my distribution network,

134
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:06,675
do you know how much money we could make?

135
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,243
I don't know.

136
00:05:08,278 --> 00:05:10,312
Maybe this'll convince you.

137
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:12,247
All right, he'll
do your I.D.'s.

138
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:14,183
But first he's got to do his day job.

139
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:16,752
He's a licensed Federal Boobie Inspector.

140
00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:18,787
Ladies.

141
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:24,159
I'm taking on a lot of risk here.

142
00:05:24,194 --> 00:05:26,762

Roger?

160
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:28,991
The name is Kevin Ramage.

161
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:30,392
Roger?

162
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:32,261
I'm only doing this one more time.

163
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:34,930
The name is Kevin Ramage.

164
00:06:34,964 --> 00:06:37,599
Word on the street is you're
horning in on my business.

165
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:40,302
Yeah, well, word on the street
is your product sucks.

166
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:42,304
Yeah, well, word on the street
is I don't have a comeback

167
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:44,840
for that, but what I do have
are these brawny sidemen.

168
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:46,542
Show them the rough stuff, boys!

169
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:50,412
If you don't get out of my territory,

170
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:51,814
this is gonna be you.

171
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:53,148
Get lost, Ramage.

172
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,684
Yeah, there's a new counterfeiter in town.

173
00:06:55,718 --> 00:06:57,286
And his name is Steve.

174
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,588
No, Hayley, I've given
a lot of thought to this.

175
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:01,123
From now on,

176
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:03,892
my name is Guttenberg.

177
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:06,462
Oh, like the inventor
of the printing press?

178
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:08,897
Steve Guttenberg invented
the printing press?

179
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:11,166
Okay, guys, I believe
we've made our point.

180
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:13,702
And if you two don't
back off my territory,

181
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:17,473
then this is what's waiting for you.

182
00:07:17,507 --> 00:07:20,142
That's right, so you better
think long and har...

183
00:07:25,548 --> 00:07:26,582
Whatever.

184
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:28,183
Okay, next I.D. is ready.

185
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:29,551
Mike Rotch?

186
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:31,420
I'm looking for Mike Rotch.

187
00:07:35,825 --> 00:07:38,894
Smith, I was tearing it up at
the Rope and Pony last night,

188
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:41,530
and I accidentally picked
up a 17-year-old girl

189
00:07:41,564 --> 00:07:43,832
all because of this!

190
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,001
Were it not for the girl's
father bursting in

191
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:48,937
at the last moment, I'd be
a sex offender right now.

192
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:52,674
Wow, I've never seen a fake I.D.
as sophisticated as this.

193
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,443
If these got into the wrong hands,

194
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:56,778
they could be a huge threat
to national security.

195
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:58,547
That's what I was trying
to tell her father

196
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:01,717
before he fell on all those
bullets coming out of my gun.

197
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:04,486
Anyway, your new priority
is to find the man

198
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:06,889
who's making these and
shut him down for good.

199
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:08,123
You can count on me, sir.

200
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:09,158
Do we have any leads?

201
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:10,159
Only one.

202
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:11,960
He goes by the name Guttenberg.

203
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:13,629
Steve Guttenberg.

204
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:17,266
But we have no record of a man
by that name ever existing.

205
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:24,872
Wow, last night was our best take ever.

206
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:26,573
Way to go, little bro.

207
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:28,709
Right back at you, big sis.

208
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:30,077
I knew it!

209
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:32,279
I knew I could find
the kitchen blindfolded.

210
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:33,981
Boy, do I know this house.

211
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,349
Uh, hey-hey, Dad.

212
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:36,617
What's new?

213
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:38,652
I've just been handed
a very important case.

214
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,021
Some master forger named Guttenberg

215
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:42,456
is making fake I.D.'s.

216
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,991
The best I've ever seen.

217
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:45,359
That's right.

218
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:46,493
He should be as nervous

219
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:47,928
as you two look right now.

220
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:50,164
All I have to do is bait the trap.

221
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:51,865
And he may be a master forger,

222
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,668
but I am a master bai... whoa!

223
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,570
Whoa, that was close.

224
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:59,873
Almost master-baited
myself there.

225
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:01,175
Did you hear that?

226
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:02,376
We got to quit!

227
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,478
Calm down.
He doesn't know it's us.

228
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:06,013
Besides, we're making too much money

229
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,614
for you to chicken out now.

230
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:10,117
And don't you like working
with your big sis?

231
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:11,618
Well... yeah.

232
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:13,453
And I can't do it without you.

233
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:15,355
You're the genius who makes it all happen.

234
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,456
You really mean that?

235
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:17,591
I do.

236
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,959
And don't worry about Dad.

237
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:20,594
I've been keeping things
from him my whole life.

238
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,296
A-ha!

239
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,298
Is playing the county fair.

240
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:26,099
Although now that I think about it,

241
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:27,634
I only know that one song.

242
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:28,936
And parking.

243
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,737
And fair food gives me the runs.

244
00:09:30,772 --> 00:09:32,272
You know what, I talked myself out of it.

245
00:09:32,307 --> 00:09:34,474
I'll leave you to your whispers.

246
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:37,945
Stan, are you coming to bed?

247
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:39,880
Oh, quite the opposite, Francine.

248
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:42,349
Not only am I not going to bed as Stan,

249
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:44,718
I'm leaving the house as someone else.

250
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,520
Feel free to ask
a follow-up question.

251
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:47,654
No, that's okay.

252
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:49,189
You see, Francine,
if I'm gonna catch a man

253
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:52,960
who sells fake I.D.'s to teens,
I need to go undercover tonight

254
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:55,596
in full <i>21 Jump Street</i> mode.

255
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:03,136
Excuse me, fellow youth.

256
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:04,938
Can I ask you where one might...?

257
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,340
Let me ask you a question first.

258
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:08,242
Can I buy you a drink?

259
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:10,110
Me?

260
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:11,511
This young thing?

261
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:12,846
Sure.

262
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:05,966
You're trembling.

263
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,768
It's just that...

264
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:10,037
I'm afraid this might be one big dream,

265
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:12,406
and I don't want to wake up.

266
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:19,112
So how did it go?

267
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:22,249
Did you get that intel
you were looking for?

268
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:23,717
Damn it!

269
00:11:26,254 --> 00:11:27,688
And so, after four dates

270
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:30,023
and a trip to the Cape with his family,

271
00:11:30,058 --> 00:11:32,125
I finally got the information
I was looking for.

272
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,927
His parents made us sleep
in separate rooms,

273
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:36,163
but, uh, you know.

274
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:39,066
Anyway, Guttenberg parks
his van at Fifth and Wellington

275
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,500
every Thursday night.

276
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:43,270
And tonight will be his last.

277
00:11:45,707 --> 00:11:47,040
Hayley, who are you calling?

278
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:48,508
Ma, I need the room.

279
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:50,644
Why don't you go down to the mall kiosk

280
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:52,279
and get yourself a nice phone case?

281
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:54,147
Ooh, you're so good to me.

282
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:58,318
Come on, Steve, pick up.

283
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,527
Uhp, out of toner again.

284
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:10,797
Uh! I told Hayley we should have
gotten a bubble jet printer.

285
00:12:10,832 --> 00:12:13,467
But she's, like,
"No, they cost too much."

286
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:16,136
And I'm like, "Yeah, but
the price per page is lower."

287
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,138
And she's, like,
"Hey, do what you want."

288
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:21,008
And I'm, like,
"No, I don't want to upset you.

289
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:22,209
Not that important."

290
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:26,013
Yup, that's how
that conversation went down.

291
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:32,619
You've Gutten away
for the last time, Guttenberg.

292
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:34,195
Berg your pardon?

293
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:36,187
Cat Gutte your tongue?

294
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,622
You're arrested!

295
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,991
You're just too Gutte to be true,

296
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,560
I won't take my cuffs off of you.

297
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:45,263
Any of those will be fine.

298
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,965
What the hell?

299
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,101
Steve! What are you
doing here?

300
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:51,702
I was just walking home for dinner

301
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,304
when somebody jumped me,

302
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:56,307
threw a bag over my head
and shoved me in Jeff's van!

303
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:58,576
Oh, yeah, this is Jeff's van.

304
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,478
Wait a minute.
What did your kidnapper say?

305
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:02,313
He said his name was Guttenberg,

306
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:04,415
and that you're Gutten colder,

307
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:08,252
and it might be a Gutt I.D.-ah
for you to give up.

308
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,988
Using my own child, and worst of all,

309
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,925
my son-in-law's van
to make me look like a fool!

310
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,693
He's toying with me.

311
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:18,596
Yeah, it's like he's
one step ahead of you.

312
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,390
That hadn't occurred to me,
but you're right!

313
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,300
He's probably watching me right now!

314
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,168
Oh, almost definitely.

315
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,603
You like to watch, Guttenberg?!

316
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:26,971
You want a show?!

317
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:28,639
Well, how do you like this?!

318
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,541
Who looks like a fool now?

319
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,947
Thank God I picked up that
second time you called.

320
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,216
I had plenty of time to
put the bag over my head

321
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,884
and tie up my hands.

322
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:41,385
But how did you hide the equipment?

323
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,954
Simple magician's patter.

324
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,488
It was all misdirection.

325
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,797
Wow. You came so close
to getting caught.

326
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,065
Were you scared?

327
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,566
No, it was a rush!

328
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,002
And now Dad has no idea what's going on.

329
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,339
It's Dad!
He figured it out!

330
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,208
Roger.

331
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,243
Kevin Ramage.

332
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,244
What do you want?

333
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,345
You're making chump change

334
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,980
selling fake I.D.'s
to teenagers.

335
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,915
The big money's in passports,

336
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:13,117
green cards, counterfeit currency.

337
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:14,919
Come work for me.
We'll make a bundle.

338
00:14:14,953 --> 00:14:16,754
Are you nuts?!
That's too dangerous.

339
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:18,149
I'm not talking to you, sweetheart.

340
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:19,490
I'm talking to the talent.

341
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:20,758
What do you say, Steve?

342
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:22,426
I say you got a lot of nerve

343
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,428
trying to come between me and my sister!

344
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:27,064
Whoa, are you okay?

345
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,066
I'm fine. I just missed
the step backing out.

346
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,835
I didn't realize how.

347
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,937
Gosh, be careful, okay?

348
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:34,171
Thanks, I will.

349
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,274
All right, good.
And stay out!

350
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,245
So, who's Guttenberg?
Are you any closer?

351
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,580
Yes, he's a teenager.

352
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:44,614
Probably working with a sibling,
but not a brother.

353
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:46,284
He's from a two-parent home.

354
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,319
Father is driven, but stunningly dim.

355
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:50,821
Mother is all over the map, but hot.

356
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,391
And there's something sexually
ambiguous living in his attic.

357
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,593
Yeah, those are
the cold facts of his life.

358
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:57,628
Tell me about the man.

359
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,097
Put it on the board.
I'm a visual thinker.

360
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,299
Okay.

361
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,433
He's smart...

362
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:04,035
he's tricky...

363
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,570
he's energetic.

364
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,639
He's very energetic.

365
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,775
See? Nothing.

366
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,611
Who are you?!

367
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:24,355
I'm gonna take a break
and check on the girls.

368
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,457
Lucky and Buttermilk have been fighting.

369
00:15:26,491 --> 00:15:28,659
Those sound like horse names,
but they're people.

370
00:15:30,028 --> 00:15:33,464
Oh, hey, what are you guys doing here?

371
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:35,299
Out-Outside
of a strip club?

372
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,601
Oh, we just come here ironically.

373
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,870
Plus I work here.

374
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,839
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

375
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:44,408
Remember when my little brother
made those fake I.D.'s?

376
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,477
Well, now we're in business together.

377
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:48,946
Wait? Ew.

378
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,816
You're business partners with
your pervy little brother?

379
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,318
Yeah, that's pretty lame.

380
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,987
What? Oh, no.

381
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,990
No, I meant my brother works for me.

382
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,058
He likes to think we're partners,

383
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,928
but I'm the genius
that makes it all happen.

384
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:06,297
I just wanted to give that loser a break

385
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:07,598
from building blanket forts.

386
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,076
Oh, uh, is Ramage here?

387
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,680
Kevin! One of your little
friends is at the door.

388
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:24,715
Can I go out with you and Kevin tonight?

389
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,752
Brandon! Leave
my friends alone!

390
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:29,820
My family sucks.

391
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,389
What do you want, Guttenberg?

392
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,590
I want in.

393
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,392
I don't care how dangerous it is.

394
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,926
I need a partner who respects me.

395
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,395
I'm glad you came around.

396
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,331
Let me go get my jacket,
and we'll get started.

397
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:43,300
So, you're a big boy, aren't ya?

398
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:48,339
Don't look so surprised.
You know it's me.

399
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,710
Steve, you ready to go to work?

400
00:16:55,738 --> 00:16:57,105
The Taiwanese are coming in

401
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,640
for the Little League World Series,

402
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:00,776
and they are looking
to buy some cigarettes.

403
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,978
Oh, but Hayley, you're the genius

404
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:04,379
who makes it all happen.

405
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:07,215
I'm just the loser
who makes blanket forts.

406
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,618
Oh... you heard that.

407
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:11,019
You're out, Hayley.

408
00:17:11,054 --> 00:17:12,254
What's this for?

409
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:13,455
The van.

410
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:15,223
It belongs to me and my new partner now.

411
00:17:15,258 --> 00:17:17,559
47 seconds.

412
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:19,528
That is a personal best.

413
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:21,496
Well, not counting Adam Levine's Jacuzzi.

414
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:24,933
But that time there was incentive!

415
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:26,034
Kevin Ramage?!

416
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,536
Steve, don't do this.

417
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,171
Working with this creep is too dangerous.

418
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:30,939
I'll take my chances.

419
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:33,041
Come on, Steve, we got
a lot of work to do.

420
00:17:33,076 --> 00:17:34,543
Plus I'm-I'm
pruning up here.

421
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:37,245
My whole body is starting
to look like Meg Ryan's neck.

422
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,548
Yeah, to hell with her for getting old.

423
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:48,657
Hayley, you spent
a lot of money on this limo

424
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:50,158
and you're
not even saying "Whoo."

425
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:52,461
I just got a lot on my mind.

426
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:55,731
Oh, that sounds awful.

427
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,604
Hey, driver, pull over!

428
00:18:04,307 --> 00:18:06,742
Wait for me. I just gotta
check on something.

429
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:08,777
We can't. We have
to stop at Kristen's house

430
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:10,912
because she accidentally wore underwear.

431
00:18:10,947 --> 00:18:13,014
Hey, I'm all for making a guy work for it,

432
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:14,916
but not that hard.

433
00:18:18,154 --> 00:18:19,688
Come on, Steve.
Chop-chop!

434
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:21,757
We gotta get these
fake passports finished.

435
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,725
These Armenians are scary people, man.

436
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,594
That Turkish genocide
just pissed them off.

437
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:27,763
That's all it did!
It just pissed them off!

438
00:18:27,797 --> 00:18:28,897
Damn it! We're late.

439
00:18:28,931 --> 00:18:30,699
We gotta get down to the docks.

440
00:18:32,435 --> 00:18:34,636
Oh, my God!
Steve's in way over his head!

441
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:36,805
Hello?

442
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,073
Dad, Steve's in trouble!

443
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:39,841
Oh, no, it's Guttenberg, isn't it?!

444
00:18:39,876 --> 00:18:40,976
He's got him again!

445
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,612
Sure, why not?
Just get to the docks now!

446
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,051
Dimitri, you old so-and-so!

447
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:51,853
Nice tracksuit, buddy.

448
00:18:51,888 --> 00:18:54,589
This is Guttenberg.
Best forger in the business.

449
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:57,993
Hi. So I-I have
your passports.

450
00:18:58,027 --> 00:18:59,995
Now what do you have for us?

451
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:01,830
These.

452
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:04,299
Uh-oh.

453
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,700
The double cross.

454
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:07,769
Classic.

455
00:19:07,804 --> 00:19:09,104
Attention, you in the warehouse!

456
00:19:09,138 --> 00:19:10,672
We have you surrounded!

457
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:14,910
This is the CIA!

458
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:16,645
Guttenberg, we know you're in there!

459
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,213
Come out with your hands up!

460
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:20,315
You want Guttenberg alive?

461
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:21,883
You let us go!

462
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:24,085
Wait. Steve is Guttenberg?

463
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,187
No!

464
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:27,189
Steve's not Guttenberg!

465
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:28,623
I am.

466
00:19:28,658 --> 00:19:29,691
You're Guttenberg?

467
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:31,359
Yes, Dad.

468
00:19:31,394 --> 00:19:33,528
And this is all my fault.

469
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:35,864
I used Steve to make
money, and-and...

470
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:40,268
Kevin Ramage!

471
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,875
Steve, thank God you're okay.

472
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:48,844
Well, Smith, you solved the case.

473
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:50,745
You found Guttenberg.
Good work.

474
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,280
Take her away.

475
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:56,485
But, sir, Guttenberg or not,
I can't arrest my own daughter.

476
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,553
Can you do it?

477
00:20:00,223 --> 00:20:02,090
Smith, your lawyer's here to see you.

478
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:03,258
Lawyer?

479
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:04,726
He says he's your lawyer.

480
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,895
His official lawyer card checks out.

481
00:20:08,998 --> 00:20:10,699
Hi, Steve.

482
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:13,468
Hayley, why'd you take the rap for me?

483
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,737
I... I felt bad.

484
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:18,840
Your life was in danger,
and it was all because of me.

485
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,476
You had a skill,
and I-I took advantage of it.

486
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,011
But we were partners,

487
00:20:23,045 --> 00:20:25,280
and then you told those girls
I was a loser.

488
00:20:25,314 --> 00:20:26,781
I know. I'm sorry.

489
00:20:26,816 --> 00:20:28,717
They-they put me on the spot,

490
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:30,919
and I was, I was just trying to look cool.

491
00:20:30,953 --> 00:20:34,422
I guess I deserve to be in here
for the next ten years.

492
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:36,925
See you when I'm 29.

493
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:38,760
Oh, you mean...

494
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:40,462
yesterday?

495
00:20:42,198 --> 00:20:43,532
Guard!

496
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:44,599
Thanks, little brother.

497
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:45,867
Any time, sis.

498
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:48,570
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got work to do.

499
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:52,741
Open up cellblock H!

500
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:56,278
Surprise inspection, ladies!
Let's whip 'em out!

501
00:20:56,312 --> 00:20:58,446
What a loser.
